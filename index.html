      <strong>
        I have fallen in love with horses since I was at a very young age. I
        love reading novels so much, and I noticed that the novels with
        storylines featuring horses were so captivating. I began to research
        horses and wanted to know more about them. Even though I wasn't
        privileged enough to be able to go to a horse farm, I knew so much about
        them, how to feed them, how to brush them. The picture of a horse I have
        put is called a Friesian horse.
